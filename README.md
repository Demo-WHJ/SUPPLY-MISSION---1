# GOAL
In Class 22, you learnt how to create a ball, respond to gravity, and make it fall, then enable it to bounce off the ground.  In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learnt in the class and design the elements of a simple game of throwing crumpled paper balls in a waste paper basket.

# STORY:
You are a sergeant on a military peacekeeping mission delivering essential medical supplies and food to a designated drop zone in a zombie infested city. The zombies don't know about this drop zone and couldn't care less about medicines.

Because of the nature of the package content, you have ensured that you pack the supplies in a safety package which is soft and will take most of the impact.

This package should bounce a couple of times, before coming to a stop.
