# SUPPLY-MISSION---1
In Class 22, you learnt how to create a ball, respond to gravity, and make it fall, then enable it to bounce off the ground.  In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learnt in the class and design the elements of a simple game of throwing crumpled paper balls in a waste paper basket.
